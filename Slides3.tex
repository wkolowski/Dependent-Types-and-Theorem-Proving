\section{Universes revisited}
% Explain Russell's paradox and then expose the lie that we have been pretending
% is true up to now (i.e. that Type : Type). Mention the universe hierarchy
% only briefly as a technical device to avoid the paradox, don't go into details.

\section{Why infinite loops are evil}
% Show how to prove a contradiction using a nonterminating program.

\section{Why throwing exceptions is evil}
% Show how to prove a contradiction by throwing an exception.

\section{Purity and referential transparency}
% Introduce (or reintroduce, depending on audience) the notions of purity
% and referential transparency the way they are understood in Haskell
% fold wisdom.

% Silly examples: Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, Mary Jane loves Peter Parker.
% Less silly examples: random() + random() != 2 * random()

\section{Effects in F*}
% Introduce the mechanism of effects as a way of control
