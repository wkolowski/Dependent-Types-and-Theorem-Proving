\section{Greetings}

\begin{frame}{General info}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The lectures will be held weekly on Fridays.
	\item Don't worry if you miss a lecture -- the slides are pretty massive and the talks are going to be recorded.
	\item Each lecture ends with some exercises which will help you familiarize yourself with F* and better understand the ideas covered in the talk.
	\item But you don't need to do them if you don't want to.
	\item This talks repo: \url{https://github.com/wkolowski/Dependent-Types-and-Theorem-Proving}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Plan of lectures}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lecture 1: Programming with dependent types.
	\item Lecture 2: Proving theorems with dependent types.
	\item Lecture 3: Differences between programming and proving.
	\item Lecture 4: Examples of bigger programs and longer proofs.
	\item Lecture 5: A deeper dive into F*.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Learning outcomes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You won't be scared of all those obscure, scary and mysterious names and notations.
	\item You will get basic familiarity with the ideas behind dependent types.
	\item You will begin to see logic and mathematics in a very different light, much closer to your day job (at least if you are a programmer working in F\#).
	\item If you do the exercises, you will gain a basic proficiency in F*.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introducing F*}
\begin{itemize}
	\item F* (pronounced ``eff star'') is a general-purpose purely functional programming language.
	\item Member of the ML family, syntactically most similar to F\#.
	\item Aimed at program verification.
	\item Dependent types.
	\item Refinement types.
	\item Effect system.
	\item Not a .NET language.
	\item Neither compiled nor interpreted -- it's a proof assistant, i.e. just a typechecker.
	\item To run a program, it has to be extracted to some other language, like F\#, OCaml, C or WASM, and then compiled.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Don't worry, be happy, ask questions}
\begin{center}
	\color{red}
	I KNOW YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PREVIOUS SLIDE, BUT BY THE END OF THESE TALKS, YOU WILL!
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Useful F* links}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{You can run F* inside your browser} (and have a nice tutorial guide you): \url{http://www.fstar-lang.org/tutorial/}
	\item GitHub: \url{https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar}
	\item Homepage: \url{http://www.fstar-lang.org/}
	\item Download: \url{http://www.fstar-lang.org/\#download}
	\item Papers (not approachable for ordinary mortals): \url{http://www.fstar-lang.org/\#papers}
	\item Talks/presentations (more approachable): \url{http://www.fstar-lang.org/\#talks} (some of these are quite approachable if you're interested)  
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To understand what we will be talking about, you should have a working knowledge of F\# and the basic concepts of functional programming, namely:
	\item Functions as first-class citizens, including higher-order functions.
	\item Algebraic data types, including sum types and product types.
	\item Pattern matching and recursion.
	\item Even if you know these, you may be unfamiliar with the particular names -- for example, ``sum types'' is a name used in academia and Haskell, but in F\# they are better known as ``tagged unions''.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Code snippet no 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We will now see some code that shows how these things look in F*.
	\item See the file \texttt{Lecture1/Prerequisites.fst}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% A definition of dependent types (types that can depend on values) and an
% example -- a good one would be the type of MxN matrices.
\section{General idea}

\begin{frame}{Values and types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To understand dependent types, first we have to understand \textbf{dependency}.
	\item And to understand dependency, we need to be aware of the distinction between \textbf{values} and \textbf{types}.
	\item By \textbf{values}, we mean the bread-and-butter of programming: numbers, strings, arrays, lists, functions, etc.
	\item It should be pretty obvious to you that in most languages, \textbf{types} are not of the same status as numbers or functions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dependency is easy to understand. In fact, if you know basic F\#, then you already know most of it, because in F\#:
	\item \textbf{Values can depend on values}: we can think that the sum \m{n + m} is a number that depends on the numbers \m{n} and \m{m}. This dependency can be expressed as a function: \m{fun (n m :\ int) -> n + m}.
	\item \textbf{Values can depend on types}: for example, the identity function \m{fun (x :\ 'a) -> x} depends on the type \m{'a}.
	\item \textbf{Types can depend on types}: for example, the F\# type \m{Set<'a>} depends on the type \m{'a}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Naming the dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I bet you spotted the pattern in the previous slide, but it's a good idea to also have a name for the feature provided by each kind of dependency.
	\item Values can depend on values: (first-class) \textbf{functions}.
	\item Values can depend on types: \textbf{polymorphism} (i.e. ``generics'').
	\item Types can depend on types: \textbf{type operators}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Dependent types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There's yet another kind of dependency, which is not present in F\#, but is present in F* and is the topic of this lecture.
	\item \textbf{Types can depend on values}: \textbf{dependent types}.
	\item But what are dependent types good for? You have been living your whole life without them, after all!
	\item Before we go on to explain dependent types, let's see some examples.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Matrix multiplication}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We can only multiply matrices whose dimensions match, i.e. we can multiply an $n \times m$ matrix by a $m \times k$ and get an $n \times k$ matrix as a result.
	\item How to model this in our favourite programming language without dependent types?
	\item The best we can do is to have \textbf{a type of matrices} \m{Matrix} and then matrix multiplication has type \m{matmult :\ Matrix -> Matrix -> Matrix}.
	\item What happens when we call it with matrices of the wrong dimensions?
	\item $\m{matmult} \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\3 & 4\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\4 & 5 & 6\\7 & 8 & 9\end{bmatrix}$ \textbf{is well-typed, but will throw} an \m{IllegalArgumentException} or some other kind of runtime error, or maybe it will crash even less gracefully.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Matrix multiplication with dependent types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In a language with dependent types we can create \textbf{a type of $n \times m$ matrices} \m{Matrix n m} and give multiplication the type \m{matmult : (n :\ $\mathbb{N}$) ->  (m :\ $\mathbb{N}$) -> (k :\ $\mathbb{N}$) -> Matrix n m -> Matrix m k -> Matrix n k}
	\item Now \m{matmult} is a function which takes five arguments: the three matrix dimensions and the two matrices themselves.
	\item After giving it the dimensions of the first matrix from the previous slide, \m{matmult 2 2} has type \m{(k :\ $\mathbb{N}$) -> Matrix 2 2 -> Matrix 2 3 -> Matrix 2 3}.
	\item It is clear that \m{matmult 2 2 k} $\begin{bmatrix}1 & 2\\3 & 4\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\4 & 5 & 6\\7 & 8 & 9\end{bmatrix}$ \textbf{is not well-typed} for any \m{k}, because the last argument is of type \m{Matrix 3 3}, but an argument of type \m{Matrix 2 k} was expected.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A nice paper}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dependent types can also be used to keep track of units of measure.
	\item This is possible in F\# too, but it's a built-in feature of the compiler, whereas the dependently typed solution is much more principled.
	\item It is also composable -- we can keep track of both matrix dimensions and units.
	\item There's a nice paper about this: \textbf{Type systems for programs respecting dimensions} available at \url{https://fredriknf.com/papers/dimensions2021.pdf}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Array access}
\begin{itemize}
	\item When accessing the $i$-th element of an array, $i$ must be smaller than the length of the array.
	\item How to model this in our favourite programming language without dependent types?
	\item We have \m{Array A}, \textbf{the type of arrays of \m{A}s}, and we can access its elements with a function \m{get :\ Array A -> int -> A}.
	\item What happens, when $i$ is greater than the length of the array? Or, what happens when $i$ is negative?
	\item \m{get [| 'a'; 'b'; 'c' ] 5} is well-typed, but will throw an \m{IndexOutOfBoundsException} or result in a segmentation fault.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Array access with dependent types 1/2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In a language with dependent types we can have \m{Array A n}, \textbf{the type of arrays of \m{A}s whose length is \m{n}}.
	\item Then we have a few possibilities to model the type of \m{get}.
	\item \m{get :\ (n :\ $\mathbb{N}$) -> Array A n -> (i :\ $\mathbb{N}$) -> i < n -> A}.
	\item In this variant, the fourth argument of \m{get} is a proof that the index isn't out of bounds (we will cover proofs in the next lecture).
	\item We can't prove \m{5 < 3}, so we don't have any proof to feed into \m{get 3 [| 'a'; 'b'; 'c' |] 5 :\ 5 < 3 -> Char}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Array access with dependent types 2/2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \m{get :\ (n :\ $\mathbb{N}$) -> Array A n -> (i :\ $\mathbb{N}$\{i < n \}) -> A}.
	\item In this variant we use refinement types (which we will cover later today) to automatically guarantee that \m{i} isn't out of bounds.
	\item \m{get 3 [| 'a'; 'b'; 'c' |] 5} is not well-typed, because the typechecker can't prove \m{5 < 3}, and thus \m{5} is not of type \m{$\mathbb{N}$\{5 < 3\}}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why should we care?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Large software systems written in dynamically typed languages are hard to refactor, because all type checks occur at runtime.
	\item Statically typed languages make the situation better, because they move these checks to compile time, making them much more likely to be useful.
	\item But in simple functional languages like F\# there's still plenty of room for dynamic runtime checks -- array bounds checking, division by zero, and a lot of user-defined checks which throw exceptions in case of failure.
	\item With dependent types, these can be eliminated, which results in \textbf{even more refactorability and maintainability}.
	\item This is also a matter of performance -- \textbf{no runtime checks means faster programs}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The running summary 1}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Dependent types are types that can depend on values}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{We're getting serious}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The above slides present nice fairy tales\dots
	\item \dots but how do dependent types actually work?
	\item And how to use them in F*?
	\item And what can ordinary programmers use them for besides number crunching with matrices and arrays?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{First-class types}

\subsection{What does ``first-class'' mean?}
% Then introduce the universe of types. At this stage we will pretend that
% Type : Type. Mentioning the universe hierarchy should be postponed to lecture 3.

\begin{frame}{Juggling dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a functional language like F\#, how to enable types to depend on values?
	\item Of course we want to retain the other kinds of dependencies (values on values, values on types, types on types).
	\item It turns out it's best \textbf{throw away all kinds of dependencies besides the basic one} (values on values)\dots
	\item \dots and then \textbf{turn types into values}!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Values and types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item So now values encompass both old, ordinary values (integers, tuples, functions, etc.) and new values (types).
	\item This way we get all four kinds of dependencies:
	\item Ordinary values can depend on ordinary values.
	\item Ordinary values can depend on type values.
	\item Type values can depend on type values.
	\item Type values can depend on ordinary values.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{First-class types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In other words, we want to blur the distinction between values and types.
	\item In yet other words, we want to \textbf{make types first-class citizens of our programming language}.
	\item But what does ``first-class'' mean?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What does ``first-class'' mean?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In C, we can define functions that take an \m{int} and return an \m{int}.
	\item But we can't define a function that takes a function from \m{int}s to \m{int}s and returns an \m{int}.
	\item This means that functions from \m{int}s to \m{int}s are not treated the same as \m{ints}.
	\item As far as C is concerned, we can say that \m{int}s are first-class, but functions are not first-class (thus, they are ``second-class'').
	\item But C has function pointers, so you may be skeptical when I claim it doesn't have first-class functions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
	
\begin{frame}{Some heuristics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The concept of ``first-class'' is neither precisely defined nor exact. Rather, it's more of a functional programming folklore that obeys the ``I know it when I see it'' principle.
	\item However there are some heuristics that can help you.
	\item Something is first-class when it can be:
	\item bound/assigned to variables.
	\item stored in data structures.
	\item passed to functions as an argument.
	\item returned from functions.
	\item constructed at runtime.
	\item nameless, i.e. it can exist without giving it any name.
	\item So, which of these is criteria is not fullfilled by C's function pointers?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A first-class quiz}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Let's have a little quiz to check if you get it.
	\item Are the below language features first-class in F\# or not? Try to think about it for up to a minute and write down your answer.
	\item Functions?
	\item Recursive functions?
	\item Arrays?
	\item Types?
	\item Modules?
	\item Records?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A type-based definition of ``first-class''}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Heuristics from previous slides are nice\dots
	\item but I prefer to think about first-class-ness in a different way, which is better from the functional programming point of view.
	\item A concept $C$ is first-class in some programming language if in that language there is, loosely speaking, a type of all $C$s.
	\item This means that a language has first-class functions if for any two types $A$ and $B$ there is a type $A \to B$ of all functions from $A$ to $B$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A first-class quiz again}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The same quiz again, but this time try to use the type-based definition of ``first-class''.
	\item Are the below language features first-class in F\# or not? Try to think about it for up to a minute and write down your answer.
	\item Functions?
	\item Recursive functions?
	\item Arrays?
	\item Types?
	\item Modules?
	\item Records?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A first-class quiz answers}
\begin{itemize}
	\color{green} \item Functions? \color{black} For any \m{'a} and \m{'b} there's a type of functions \m{'a -> 'b}.
	\color{red} \item Recursive functions? \color{black} There's no separate type of recursive functions, even though there's a syntactic distinction between \m{let} and \m{let rec}!
	\color{green} \item Arrays? \color{black} For any type \m{'a} there's a type of arrays, namely \m{array<'a>}.
	\color{red} \item Types? \color{black} There are types in F\# and there are type variables \m{a'}, \m{b'}, \m{c'} etc., but we can't assign them any type!
	\color{red} \item Modules? \color{black} Modules are not first-class, they have a whole separate world of their own.
	\color{yellow}\item Records? \color{black} This one is mixed depending on how you understand it. On the one hand, for any kind of record you can imagine, there's a corresponding type. But on the other hand, there is no type of all record types.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Computing with first-class types}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Previously we learned that ``making $X$ first-class'' means adding a type of all $X$s.
	\item For types, this means that we need to have a \textbf{type of types}.
	\item And that's it -- we don't need anything else.
	\item Because types are first-class in F*, we can assign them to variables, pass them to functions as arguments and return them from functions, and even compute types by recursion.
	\item It might a bit difficult to wrap your head around this idea, so let's see how it looks in F*.
	\item The code snippet can be found in \m{Lecture1/FirstClassTypes.fst}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The running summary 2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dependent types are types that can depend on values.
	\color{red} \item 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Leading example: compute printf's type from format string.

\section{Dependent functions}
% Introduce pi types by analogy with ordinary function type.
% Always call it "dependent function type" and use F* notation
% (i.e. (x : A) -> P x) to minimize confusion.

% Show some silly examples, like returning results of different types in
% different if-branches. Maybe compare this to dynamic typing and underline
% the differences.

\subsection{Example: typesafe printf}
% Finish the typesafe printf example.

\subsection{How to express polymorphism}
% Polymorphic functions are just dependent functions with Type arguments.
% Mention how this relates to type constructors, i.e. list : Type -> Type.

\subsection{Implicit arguments and how to read function signatures}
% Mention that with dependent types, we can infer some arguments from
% the types of others, so we don't want to explicitly write all arguments.

\section{Dependent pairs}
% Introduce sigma types by analogy with ordinary products.
% Always call it "dependent pair type" and use F* notation
% (i.e. (x : A) * P x) to minimize confusion.

\subsection{Example: everybody loves filling forms}
% An example, something along the lines of how to use dependent pairs
% to avoid forms with "not applicable" fields.

\section{Optional: some arithmetic}
% An optional section.

\subsection{Sigma}
% Introduce the sigma notation for dependent pair types.
% Explain it by parallels with math's sigma notation for
% addition. Introduce the name "dependent sum (type)".

\subsection{Pi}
% Introduce the pi notation for dependent function types.
% Explain it by parallels with math's pi notation for
% multiplication. Introduce the name "dependent product (type)".

\subsection{Plus, cross and arrow}
% Explain that dependent pair types are a generalization of
% both sum types and product types.

% Explain that dependent function types are a generalization of
% both product types and function types.

\section{Inductive families}
% Refresher on ordinary algebraic data types.
% Introduce inductive families by analogy with ordinary algebraic
% data types.

\subsection{Example: length-indexed lists}
% Vectors - the canonical example of an inductive family.
% Mention problems with partial functions like head and tail
% and how to turn them into total functions on vectors.

\subsection{Example: enforcing protocols}
% Look up Idris tutorials/manuals/books for some example
% on how to use inductive families for enforcing protocols,
% i.e. for using sockets.

\section{Intrinsic vs extrinsic style}
% Is it better to define indexed inductive types like vectors
% or go with ordinary inductive types and constrain them with
% predicates using dependent pairs? Well, neither and this
% leads us to...

\section{Refinement types}
% Introduce refinement types, using F* notation (i.e. x : int{x > 5}).
% Go over the head/tail example again, but this time using refinements
% on ordinary lists.

\section{Exercises}
% No idea yet.
